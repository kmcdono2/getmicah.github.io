Developed and taught undergraduate courses such as seminars on environment and politics in rural France, the environmental history of European empires, and the history of mapping (18th-21st c.). Innovations in Mapping: From Paper to Pixels received funding from the Bates Harward Center for Community Engagement to support field trips to local practitioners. This course counted towards the “Lab” science requirement at Bates, the first History course to do so. [Course website](https://course-wp.bates.edu/mappinginnovations/). [Story covering the course](https://www.bates.edu/news/2016/05/20/here-be-bates-a-history-lab-puts-the-college-on-the-map/). Three of my courses were cross-listed with Environmental Studies. 

2014-15	**Stanford University, Stanford, CA, Lecturer in History and Philosophy of Science and Writing & Rhetoric**. 
Taught as part of a team in a year-long, residential History of Science program, Science in the Making¬-Integrated Leaning Environment (SIMILE). Because of my joint appointment, I helped to coordinate lectures linked to discussion sections, field trips, and writing seminars. I designed the writing seminars to connect students with how people in the past explored and communicated about science, medicine, and technology. News about SIMILE [here](http://shc.stanford.edu/news/research/stanford-freshmen-create-medieval-inspired-artifacts-twenty-first-century) and [here](http://news.stanford.edu/news/2014/july/simile-residential-learning-070814.html).

In two sections of 27 students each, the focus was on transitioning to college-level humanities coursework. Self-designed [course website](https://mcworldhistory.wordpress.com/). 

2007-11	**Department of History, Stanford University, Teaching Fellow and Assistant**. Designed and taught new required methodology course for history majors (Mobility in France and the Self: People, Products, and Ideas in Motion, 1700-2000). Prepared and led discussion sections for undergraduates in Global Human Geography, Machiavellian Moments, Europe 1500-1793, and Colonial and Revolutionary America.
