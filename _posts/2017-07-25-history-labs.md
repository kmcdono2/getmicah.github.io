**Work in progress**

I'm redesigning the lab activities I designed for the "Innovations in Mapping" course I taught at Bates College (Short Term 2016). My goal is to make these easily adaptable for others who want to incorporate mapping experiences (both analogue and digital) in their teaching.

Check out the original documentation and the wiki as I re-write the labs:
