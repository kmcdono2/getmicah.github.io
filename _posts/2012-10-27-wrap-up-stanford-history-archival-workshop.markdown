On October 16, the [Stanford History Archival Workshop](http://archivalworkshop.wordpress.com/)Â (SHAW) hosted its final event. A group of archivists from the Stanford campus met with graduate students from the History department as well as guests from the San Jose State University's School of Library and Information Sciences to share the latest and greatest of their collections processing and digital projects. Having thought about putting together such an event since last spring, I was excited to see it come to fruition. The Stanford Archivists group, led by [Drew](http://med.stanford.edu/irt/edtech/contacts/bourn.html) [Bourn](http://usingsfhistory.com/about/) in the Stanford Medical Library (also a History PhD!), were generous with their time and I believe that we have planted a seed for greater collaboration between History students and archival staff on campus. Archivists were able to advertise for student research positions, and students were able to learn about the variety of international collections held at on campus repositories - collections that they might work with as researchers, teachers, or interns.
