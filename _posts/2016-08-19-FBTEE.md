title: FBTEE and Mapping Print, Charting Enlightenment Project
---

These days I'm writing regularly over on the [FBTEE Blog](https://frenchbooktrade.wordpress.com/author/kmcdono2/)  

FBTEE = French Book Trade in Enlightenment Europe
Mapping Print, Charting Enlightenment = the Australian Research Council funded project that includes revamping FBTEE as well as a host of other DH work.  

We are using the space to share news about developments in 18th c. French DH, global book history, and internal project news.
