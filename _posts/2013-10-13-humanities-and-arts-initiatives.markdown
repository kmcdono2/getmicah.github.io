These are a few of the projects I have been working on this year:





	
  * Launching the H-STEP Fellowship for Stanford humanities PhD recipients to enroll (with full funding) in the Stanford Teacher Education Program. This new initiative was covered by Inside Higher Ed [last year](http://www.insidehighered.com/news/2013/05/24/phds-teachers-and-other-ideas-emerge-panel-doctoral-reform-stanford).


	
  * Coordinating [new funding](https://undergrad.stanford.edu/opportunities-research/humanities) for Stanford undergrad humanities+arts majors to take a summer business bootcamp.


	
  * Collaborating with department chairs and the Admissions office on discipline-specific mailings to high school students (and prospective Stanford applicants) interested in humanities fields.


	
  * Designing new services and programming for humanities undergraduates and graduates to prepare them for careers within and beyond academia.


	
  * This fall and winter, I am beginning a project to tell stories on the radio about humanities research in collaboration with the [Stanford Storytelling Project](http://www.stanford.edu/group/storytelling/cgi-bin/joomla/).


	
  * Assisting with the first year of a new student exchange program between the City College of New York and Stanford that aims to [diversify the humanities professoriate](http://news.stanford.edu/news/2013/september/ccny-humanities-exchange-091913.html).
