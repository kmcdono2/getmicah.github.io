#### MMF3		2016-18	
AM collaborates with Mapping Print, Charting Enlightenment project


1. What research questions drove database development?
2. What interpretative interventions were made?
3. What is new about the MMF3 phase?


1. What research questions drove database development?

###### Martin/Frautschi 2002: 
- What is the level of production of first editions and re-editions?
- Who are the most prolific authors of the 18th c?
- What were the most reprinted fiction works?
- What words appear most frequently in titles?
- What can we learn about stated publication places and publishers?

#### AM @ SHARP 2016:
- Would a large number of present-day library locations reveal not only large print runs but also something about the reception of works in different geographical areas?
- Is there a correlation between a large number of re-editions and a large number of surviving copies? 


2. What interpretative interventions were made?

###### Defining the fields for data capture

###### Developing a method for differentiating between works and editions (first editions/subsequent editions)

###### Connecting edition data with current holdings

3. What is new about the MMF3 phase?	

###### Focus on data relationships, shift to relational database

###### Connecting metadata

###### Thinking geographically
- False/fictitious publication places (A Sodome et à Cythère. Et se trouvent plus qu'ailleurs dans la poche de ceux qui le condamnent)

- Locating places

###### Accessibility (data dump, API, linked data)

#### Lessons
- Bibliographic data isn't just about books
- Databases are an intermediary between sources and researchers - what & who these are changes over time
- Inter-generational research projects highlight the effects of "datafication" of the archive


#### Results To Come!
- Transforming 21553 records of works and editions 
- Locating 2830 Library locations and ~ 600 publication places
- Linking to existing FBTEE database + others
- Hoping for a WorldCat API connection
