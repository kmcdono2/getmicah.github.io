### Mapping the French Novel
#### Lessons and Results from the Digitization of the Print Bibliography of 18th-century French Novels


#### http://fbtee.uws.edu.au/mpce/


#### MMF1		1970s	Angus Martin, Vivienne Mylne, and Richard Frautschi, eds. Bibliographie du genre romanesque français, 1700-1750 (London: Mansell Information Publishing, 1977)
#### MMF2		1980s-2010s AM, VM, RF continue revising original entries, adding pre-1700 entries and 1700-1750 entries in computer database
#### MMF3		2016-18	AM collaborates with Mapping Print, Charting Enlightenment project


### 1. What research questions drove database development?
### 2. What interpretative interventions were made?
### 3. What is new about the MMF3 phase?


### 1. What research questions drove database development?
#### Mylne 1981:
#### “Statistics of re-editions…can serve as a criterion of the relative popularity of various works, and this in turn may help to explain certain fashions or trends among writers.” (The Eighteenth-Century Novel, 275) 


#### Martin/Frautschi, “French Prose Fiction Published between 1701 and 1750,” Eighteenth-Century Fiction, 2002: 
#### What is the level of production of first editions and re-editions?
#### Who are the most prolific authors of the 18th c?
#### What were the most reprinted fiction works?
#### What words appear most frequently in titles?
#### What can we learn about stated publication places and publishers?


#### AM in 2012:
##### How can documenting 18th-c. editions of works first printed before 1700 shed light on “the rise and fall in popularity of authors and of titles over three centuries”? (proposal to Voltaire Foundation)


#### AM @ SHARP 2016:
##### “Would a large number of present-day library locations reveal not only large print runs but also something about the reception of works in different geographical areas?” 
##### “Is there a correlation between a large number of re-editions and a large number of surviving copies? 
How does one interpret ‘collaborative’ editions, where the same printing is issued under a number of different title pages bearing the names of different publishers? What does it mean when there are a large number of library copies for some editions and not for others?
 Do pirate editions achieve lower or higher numbers of copies? 
To what extent does the current geographical representation of copies coincide with their original distribution in the eighteenth century?” 


#### RF and AM @ ISECS 2015: Micro & Macro questions
##### Micro = “researchers seek more detailed descriptions of individual first and re-editions” for “patterns of actual production locations, print materials, and font styles” 
##### Macro = “patterns of content, narrative form and location as these evolved’ over time and space 


#### Quantitative study of the French novel with computational methods
#### Literary questions


#### 2. What interpretative interventions were made?
##### Defining the fields for data capture
##### Adopting database model for MMF2 (Notebook software)
##### Developing a method for differentiating between works and editions (first editions/subsequent editions)
##### Choosing at first to limit the bibliography to 1750-1800, then expanding the digitized database to the entire century
##### Choosing to travel to specific libraries where edition examples could be located, later using WorldCat/CCF/COPAC/KVK/emails to librarians to verify holdings
##### Excluding chap books/la bibliothèque bleue from the database


#### 3. What is new about the MMF3 phase?	
### Our questions: social, economic, political, and cultural


#### What did the French read before the revolution of 1789-1799 and how did their reading compare to that of francophone readers elsewhere? How might that reading have shaped ideologies and events?


#### What books were produced, where were they consumed and by whom? How far can we speak of integrated national and international markets or a single print culture embracing both urban and rural areas?


#### How cosmopolitan was fictional and non-fictional reading fare, and what might this indicate about the social and political imagination of the revolutionary generation? 


### Our interpretations:
##### Focus on data relationships, shift to relational database
##### Identifying first editions as “works,” subsequent editions as “manifestations,” and library copies as “instances” (adopting a FRBR framework)
##### Deciding how to make the data publicly available (data dump, API, linked data)
##### Thinking about place/publication data geographically
##### Improving prosopographical metadata for authors, publishers, editors, etc. (through access to BnF metadata)


### Our outputs:
##### Connected to projects, repositories, and other semantic web resources
##### Graphically visualized
##### Available digitally and in print
