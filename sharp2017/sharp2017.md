AM collaborates with Mapping Print, Charting Enlightenment project


1. What research questions drove database development?
2. What interpretative interventions were made?
3. What is new about the MMF3 phase?


#### What research questions drove database development?

###### Martin/Frautschi 2002: 

- What is the level of production of first editions and re-editions?
- Who are the most prolific authors of the 18th c?
- What were the most reprinted fiction works?
- What words appear most frequently in titles?
- What can we learn about stated publication places and publishers?


#### AM @ SHARP 2016:

- Would a large number of present-day library locations reveal not only large print runs but also something about the reception of works in different geographical areas?
- Is there a correlation between a large number of re-editions and a large number of surviving copies? 


#### What interpretative interventions were made?

###### Defining the fields for data capture
45 data fields in Notebook software

###### Developing a method for differentiating between works and editions (first editions/subsequent editions)

###### Connecting edition data with current holdings

#### What is new about the MMF3 phase?	
Focus on data relationships, shift to relational database

###### Thinking geographically


False/fictitious publication places 

Henry Cotton, **A Typographical Gazetteer** (Oxford, 1831)

--> A Sodome et a Cythere. Et se trouvent plus qu'ailleurs dans la poche de ceux qui le condamnent.

#### Lessons for now

Databases are an **intermediary** between sources and researchers - what & who these are changes over time (intentional design for future users)

Inter-generational research projects highlight the effects of **datafication** of the archival sources (layers of interpretation, coding)



#### Results To Come!

Transforming 21553 records of works and editions

Locating 2830 repositories and ~ 600 publication places

Linking to existing FBTEE database + others

Hoping for a WorldCat API connection
