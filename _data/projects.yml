  description: Over the course of the eighteenth century, highways in France changed from being isolated, narrow roads to becoming everyday spaces that welcomed public coaches, private carriages, and peasant foot traffic. The transformation of the public road in provincial France stimulated trade, political interaction, and population transfers between rural hinterlands and urban centers. Before roads were the conduits of people and information, however, they were the objects of discussion by the people who were called upon to construct them. Communication about this aspect of the rural built environment brought conflicting ideas about the utility of roads to light. The process of building roads fostered conversations about rural life and land that were the foundation for new justifications of public utility by provincial leaders. Public utility, long before it became a common phrase during the Revolution, became a platform for shaping a provincial administrative identity. Provincial leaders meant to rationalize the organization of activities like road construction to contrast with the disorderly management of peasant labor and engineering expertise that had been overseen in the first half of the eighteenth century by the king’s representative, the Intendant.
Collected knowledge about road construction technology that had either been part of the heritage of ancient architecture or the practice of rural land management now collided in the socially and politically complex project to build highways. My research uncovers the depth of discussions about building roads in eighteenth-century communities and their significance for the formation of a new idea of participatory politics. By registering rural villages and towns in Brittany as important locations for establishing new ideas about public utility, the provincial administration in turn reshaped their role into that of a publicly responsible institution decades before new Revolutionary institutions made this change across France. As communication about road construction flourished, the archives of the provincial Estates became the repository of knowledge and the documentary home of the social network of laborers, engineers, and administrators. Without the highway construction site as a location of interaction of people and ideas, much of the motivation for modernizing provincial administrations would have been lost.
Standing at the intersection of the history of technology and the history of politics in early modern France, the development of highways in provincial France offers an ideal lens through which to study interactions among social groups often portrayed as highly divided. The long-standing theme of a changing social fabric leading to social disorder and revolution has made the history of interactions across socio-economic categories a fundamental issue in the study of eighteenth-century France (J. Collins). Yet rarely are roads considered to be the collaborative work of rural labor, elite administrators, and engineers. Instead, historians relying on the typology of social groups generated by histories of the Revolution have built a narrative about roads that depicts rural workers as negligent, overburdened, or lazy, and engineers as glorified public servants (G. Lefebvre, D. Roche). Only recently, in the work of new historians of provincial administrations, has attention been paid to the more complex process of building roads from a grounded perspective of local governance (M.-L. Legay, J. Swann). Significant work remains to be done, however, to assess the relationship between the construction of public works, such as the highways described in my dissertation, and the early modern French person’s relationship to the surrounding landscape. If elites in the provincial administration of the Estates were adept at adding a new culture of provincially organized public works to the older culture of seigneurial rights, rural inhabitants continued to examine plans for development with an eye to village or personal interests. How did provincial leaders and engineers give shape to the language of “provincial” interests through their public works activities? What was the significance of this concept to rural communities in the eighteenth century and beyond?

  description: I capture a turning point in territorial development when public works outgrew medieval organizational methods, and provincial leaders sought to establish new controls over land and labor. In their approach to public works, leaders of the French province of Brittany took older compulsory labor and estate management practices and shaped them into enlightenment-era administrative methods. My study of provincial highway construction brings to light long overlooked connections between early modern people, their local built environment, and their political sensibilities.
Monumental highways and Parisian engineers have been featured as extensions of the centralizing absolutist state in older scholarship. This high political perspective ignores the practical realities of building roads in rural areas as well as the growth of provincial administrative powers in the eighteenth century. My analysis of archival sources demonstrates that provincial road construction was a local experience shared across the three Estates. These sources provide new avenues for examining the spatial dynamics that were a part of Old Regime political sociabilities. Managerial expertise, increased provincial authority, and a transformed concept of the “public domain,” rather than simply the creation of a road network, were the lasting results of the highway construction boom.
Chapters One and Two introduce the transportation landscape and the reformed corvée labor regime that was crucial to the improvement of France’s highways. As a historical practice, the corvée has been subsumed by the congratulatory narrative of its abolition during the French Revolution instead of being scrutinized as a practice that gave rural communities a voice in provincial administrative institutions.
Chapter Three investigates the context and impact of administrative surveys of road-building practices conducted by the Breton Estates in 1764 and 1769. The experience of these surveys became central to the Estates’ ability to claim authority over highway administration. Road construction brought to light competing discourses of public utility, and the Estates’ rise to power in public works administration set in motion conflicts between representatives of parishes, the province, and the crown.
Chapters Four and Five analyze the identities of and technologies developed by administrators and engineers as they pursued provincial highway construction. Members of the Breton Estates emerged in the 1770s as conscientious administrators because of their experience with private, municipal, and ecclesiastical property management as well as their earlier associations with the Intendant, the Commandant, engineers, parish officials, and contractors. Engineers were key actors in a road construction industry that replaced the older system of local maintenance organized by lords, municipalities, or property owners. Their interactions with the built environment of rural Brittany transformed their (and eventually the public’s) perceptions of rural landscapes.
“Public” once meant royal, but the road construction experience was key in broadening the word’s definition to include civic engagement and provincial administration. Use of the corvée to build highways introduced rural communities to the idea of provincial public administration. The highway – part of the royal domain – was transformed by the act of construction into an active, communal space in the countryside. The experiences of workers in this rural space, combined with debates about corvée reforms, laid the groundwork for thinking about roads and other parts of the public domain as democratic spaces.
