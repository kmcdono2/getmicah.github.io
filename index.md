# About me

I am a historian of France currently affiliated with a Digital
Humanities Project on the [French Book Trade during the Enlightenment](http://fbtee.uws.edu.au/main/) at
Western Sydney University. 

My research is intensively archival. While my dissertation was first inspired by the methods of social
and political historians in France, I also the tend to link my sources - manuscript
provincial maps or parish assembly records, for example - to the history
of ideas and technology.

My book manuscript is a political and social history of highway
construction in western France before the Revolution. I explore how and
why the experience of building a highway changed from the early years of
the 18th century to the end of the century, and the political
significance of this provincial public works project. Using the archives
of the public works administrations in the province of Brittany, this is
the first book-length project with a focus on the forced labor system of
the corvée in almost a century. 

I am completing articles on the history of road design in early modern Europe and the role of
18th-century road maps in the establishment of provinces as modern
territorial regions. My next major project will extend my work on the
French highway corvée into the Atlantic. The relationship between labor
systems and the local built environment in 18th c. western France
resulted in general agreement about public utility until labor
expectations exceeded local parish needs. The acceptance of forced labor
was directly tied to status and state of physical structures deemed
useful in the context of economic and cultural behaviors. How did this
change in French settlements across the ocean? What assumptions about
laborers and the physical fabric of communities transferred and which
were rejected? I write periodically on this blog about history research
and teaching, higher ed, archives, and radio/podcasts. 

In 2015-16 I
taught in the History department at Bates College in Lewiston, Maine.
During the 2014-15, I
was a [Lecturer](https://undergrad.stanford.edu/programs/residential-
programs/simile/simile-faculty) in a freshman residential program with a
history of science, technology, and medicine theme ([Science in the
Making Integrated Learning Environment,
SIMILE](https://undergrad.stanford.edu/programs/residential-programs/
science-making-integrated-learning-environment-simile)). In
research-intensive composition courses, I helped students analyze how
and why people in the past wrote about math, science or technology and,
in turn, how they could develop as writers exploring the history of
science. I was affiliated with the Program in Writing and Rhetoric at
Stanford. From June 2013-September 2014, I worked in the School of
Humanities and Sciences Dean's Office at Stanford on projects related to
undergraduate and graduate humanities education. I completed my PhD in
History at Stanford in June 2013. There, I was the co-founder (with Lauren Jarvis) of
the Stanford History Archival Workshop, which, in addition to practical
sessions about how to do archival research, brought together Bay area
scholars and archivists to explore the history and the future of
archives.
